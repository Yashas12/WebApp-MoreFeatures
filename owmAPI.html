                OpenWeatherMap is an online service, owned by OpenWeather Ltd, that provides global weather data, including current weather data, forecasts, nowcasts and historical data (starting from 1979), utilising meteorological broadcast services and raw data from airport weather stations, radar stations and other weather stations.
                The company has more than 2 million customers, ranging from independent developers to Fortune 500 companies. <br>

It provides more than twenty weather APIs, with almost 7000 repositories on GitHub. The APIs support multiple languages, units of measurement and data formats. <br>

The platform uses OpenStreetMap to display weather maps, and it provides many of its services free of charge. But despite the name of the platform, it is not open to user contributions, and most of their services require paid subscriptions. <br> <br>
